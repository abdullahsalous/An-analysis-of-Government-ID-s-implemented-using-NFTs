\begin{abstract}
In the United States, traditional government-issued IDs such as driver's licenses, Social Security numbers, and passports are increasingly vulnerable to fraud, forgery, and data misuse. As a potential alternative, this paper explores the feasibility of a blockchain-based digital identification system using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While the concept of on-chain identity is still emerging, several real-world implementations such as Proof of Humanity, Gitcoin Passport, and Polygon ID offer foundational insights. This study empirically analyzes these existing Web3 identity projects to identify their strengths, limitations, and technical design patterns. Additionally, the paper proposes a prototype schema for NFT-based identity credentials. The proposed approach will be compared against current U.S. ID systems, focusing on security, scalability, data minimization, and legal implications. The goal is to determine whether identity NFTs can practically enhance or complement national identity infrastructure in an effective way.
