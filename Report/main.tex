\begin{abstract}
In the United States, traditional government-issued IDs such as driver's licenses, Social Security numbers, and passports are increasingly vulnerable to fraud, forgery, and data misuse. As a potential alternative, this paper explores the feasibility of a blockchain-based digital identification system using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While the concept of on-chain identity is still emerging, several real-world implementations such as various implementations of Proof of Humanity offer foundational insights. This study empirically analyzes these existing Web3 identity projects to identify their strengths, limitations, and technical design patterns. Additionally, the paper proposes a prototype schema for NFT-based identity credentials. The proposed approach will be compared against current U.S. ID systems, focusing on security, scalability, data minimization, and legal implications. The goal is to determine whether identity NFTs can practically enhance or complement national identity infrastructure in an effective way.

\section{Introduction}
In the age of technology, identity theft is an increasing and pertinent issue to many Americans. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, approximately 23.9 million U.S. residents aged 16 or older (9\% of the population) experienced identity theft in 2021, while nearly 1 in 5 adults reported having been victims at some point in their lives \cite{Bureau of Justice Statistics}. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ID Theft}, data from the Federal Trade Commission shows a steady rise in reports of fraud, identity theft, and related issues over the past five years, with a significant spike in 2021. On average, identity theft alone accounts for approximately 300,000 reports each year. These incidents often involve the misuse of personal information such as Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, and bank details, leading to financial loss, legal complications, and long-term reputational damage.

Despite the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity tools, traditional government-issued forms of identification remain vulnerable to theft, forgery, and data breaches. One significant concern is the widespread use of fake IDs, which are commonly used not only by underage individuals for age-restricted purchases, but also by criminals for more serious offenses such as identity fraud, illegal immigration, and financial scams. According to "IDScan.net", a study conducted found that 12.5\% of high school students admitted to possess a fake ID, and 32.2\% of college students under 21 admitted to possess it as well \cite{fake ID's}. As of 2024, CBS News reported that approximately 40,000 migrants from South and Central America entered the U.S. without authorization, with many resorting to purchasing counterfeit identification documents as a means of securing work to support their families \cite{cbs-news}. This shows the ease with which physical documents like driver's licenses or passports can be counterfeited or altered, thus highlights the limitations of document-based verification. Additionally, centralized identity repositories have proven to be high-value targets for cyberattacks. For instance, the 2015 breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the personal data of over 21.5 million people \cite{opm}. These vulnerabilities expose structural weaknesses in existing systems and underscore the urgent need for more tamper-resistant, secure, and verifiable methods of identity management.

Blockchain technology, particularly through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) presents a compelling alternative. These systems offer the promise of tamper-proof, self-sovereign digital identity that can be cryptographically verified and selectively disclosed by users. Several projects have begun experimenting with this concept, including various implementations of Proof of Humanity, each offering a different take on how identity can be established and managed on-chain.

Despite these innovations, the integration of blockchain-based identity into national systems like that of the U.S. remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether NFT-based identity systems built on platforms like Ethereum could provide a more secure, privacy-preserving, and user-controlled framework for digital identification. By comparing blockchain-based identity models to current U.S. government systems, and by analyzing real-world blockchain data, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of adopting such technology at scale.


\section{Background \& Related Work}
The internet is rapidly evolving with the emergence of Web3, a new phase defined by decentralization, user ownership, and cryptographic security. Unlike the current Web2 landscape, where user data is controlled by centralized platforms, Web3 empowers individuals to manage their own identities and digital assets without relying on third parties \cite{what-is-web3}. This shift introduces new possibilities for privacy-preserving and tamper-resistant identity systems. Several projects, such as various implementations of Proof of Humanity are already exploring how decentralized technologies can reshape how we approach identity authentication.

\subsection{Decentralization}
When discussing any system, it is important to understand the system and the environment that surrounds it. Web3 technology shifts away from centralization, and hierarchical distribution, to a decentralized system. A decentralized system is a system where components operate on local information to achieve goals, rather than the result of a central ordering influence. This removes the need for a system to rely on a centralized authority and thus can unleash enormous potential in the space of identity verification. Centralized ID systems, create single points of failure which makes them vulnerable to data breaches, censorship, or misuse of authority. Figure \ref{fig:decentralized} helps visualize the difference between the various existing systems and the theoretical fault tolerance of a decentralized system.

\subsection{Blockchain}
A blockchain is a data structure that is analogous to an append-only linked list. This ledger is distrubuted to form a distributed system. Additionally, adding to the ledger is done without a central authority using a consensus mechanism, which ensures agreement across the network on the validity of new transactions. In Ethereum’s case, this consensus is maintained by validators, who propose and attest to new blocks in exchange for rewards, thereby securing the network. Ethereum is a blockchain with a computer embedded in it. This system was revolutionary in that it was the first platform to introduce the concept of smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs uploaded and executed by the network. These programs are executed in a quasi–Turing complete programming environment by using gas to ensure that a program halts. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) maintains a consistent world state across all nodes in the network. There are two types of accounts defined by Ethereum: externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys, and contract accounts; which are governed by smart contract code. In our case, this can allow users to interact with smart contracts to register, verify, and manage digital identities without the need for a centralized entity.

\subsection{Proof of Humanity}
Proof of Humanity (PoH) is a decentralized identity verification system designed to ensure that participants in a digital ecosystem are real, human individuals rather than bots \cite{what-is-poh}. As artificial intelligence grows increasingly capable of mimicking human behavior and speech, the need for reliable human verification has become more urgent. Proof of Humanity addresses this challenge by combining social verification with a reputation-based system on the Ethereum blockchain. There are many different implementations of Proof of Humanity. In this paper, we will explore a few of these implementations. 

The first implementation to examine is Proof of Humanity by Kleros. PoH by Kleros requires users to first connect an online wallet. The wallet address provided by the user is publicly linked to their identity. Then, the registration process begins. Registration requires a user to submit a name, photo, and video holding their wallet address. They are then vouched for by an existing verified member. This crowd-sourced, tamper-resistant approach can reduce the risk of Sybil attacks and fake accounts while giving users greater control over their online interactions. By removing the need for centralized authorities, Proof of Humanity by Kleros seeks to offer a trustable and scalable framework for authenticating digital identity in Web3.
